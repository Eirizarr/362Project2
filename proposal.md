Booking System: When going to buy airplane tickets, the user will be presented with a form that asks them for their departing location, arriving location, the date they want to leave, the date they want to return, enter in the number of people (children, adults, babies, and seniors), and option for round trip or one way. Once entered, they will be presented with a page listing all the available flights for the given time and location. They select their desired flight, they are then presented with the ticket they selected with special faq(frequently asked questions), policies, and a form to enter their card information. The form will ask for their first and last name, card number, exp date, cvc number, and zip code. Once confirmed, they will get a confirmation notice with their name and tickets purchased.
